/**
 * Which key was actually pressed, on any keyboard layout.
 *
 * Brought over from chevaletNote unchanged, where it was measured in a real Firefox; the
 * notes on this board are that extension's notes, and they answer to the same keys in the
 * same way on the same keyboards.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * Every shortcut in the note used to be matched against `KeyboardEvent.key`, which is the
 * character the *active layout* produces. With a Persian layout the physical S key reports
 * `key === 'س'`, the Z key reports `'ز'`, and so every letter shortcut in the extension --
 * `S` for settings, `C` for colour, `D` for draw, `L`, `M`, `P`, `E`, and `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`
 * for undo -- silently did nothing. Backspace, Delete, Escape and the arrows kept working,
 * because their `key` values do not depend on the layout at all. That lopsided pattern is
 * exactly what got reported, from a machine that types Persian all day.
 *
 * Measured, not deduced, in the extension: a real Firefox shows `س` with `code: 'KeyS'`
 * reaching the handler and being ignored, next to `s` with the same code being honoured.
 *
 * ## The rule, and why it is not simply "use `code`"
 *
 * `e.key` wins whenever it is an ASCII letter; `e.code` is the fallback. Reaching for `code`
 * first would be wrong for Dvorak and Colemak: those are Latin layouts, and someone on Dvorak
 * pressing the key that PRINTS "z" expects undo, even though its `code` is `KeyY`. Browsers
 * resolve their own accelerators the same way -- layout character first, physical position
 * only when the layout gives no Latin letter -- which is why Ctrl+Z works in a Cyrillic layout
 * in every browser.
 *
 * So:
 *
 *   layout    physical key    e.key   e.code    letterOf()   why
 *   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   en-US     Z               'z'     'KeyZ'    'z'          key is a Latin letter
 *   Dvorak    ;               'z'     'KeyY'    'z'          key wins: the user sees "z"
 *   fa        Z               'ز'     'KeyZ'    'z'          key is not Latin; code decides
 *   ru        Z               'я'     'KeyZ'    'z'          same
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM, so it is unit-tested without a browser.
